## 1.0.10

Clean code, instead of relying on error suppression.

## 1.0.9

Exception class has been having the same functionality as the one
from atk4/core, so we have finally added dependency for atk4/core
and exndended their exception.

To celebrate this fact, we have added additional infromation
through params to all the places where we use Exceptions.


## 1.0.8

Calling `$dsql->set('foo', 4)->set('foo', 10);` now works differently.
It used to record "foo=10" in insert/update record, but now it will
simply add both statement. With MySQL at least the first value is
used.

Calling set() multiple times should behave similarly how adding
multiple conditions on the same field. It's not up to DSQL to
select which value to use.

* Field in set() can now be an expression
* Improved formatting a bit

## 1.0.7

* Fix test-suite bugs introduced in 1.0.6

## 1.0.6

* Fix problem when more than 28 parameters are specified
* Permit use of JOIN and table alias in MySQL update

## 1.0.5

* added transaction support
* made getDebugQuery() use false by default
* Style Improvement

## 1.0.4

* added getDebugQuery(false) which will output in TEXT instead of HTML
* bugfixes

## 1.0.3

* fix bug preventing from passing float as parameters

## 1.0.2

Minor cleanups and improvements to code coverage

* improve __toString() handling, will not attempt to catch exception

## 1.0.1

This is now our first stable release. It features clean-ups from 1.0.0:

* selectTemplate() is replaced with mode()
* upadted docs to use $c->query() instead of "new Query()" (better use pattern)
* added examples for having()
* added method reset()
* added method option()
* Expressionable now receives parent $expression as argument
* documented orExpr(), andExpr()
* documented template_* properties
* improved PSR compatibility
* escapeChar is dropped (too generic)
